# Welcome! 👋

My name is Dhruv Patel, and I'm a senior at the Ilinois Math and Science Academy (IMSA). I'm interested in full-stack app and web development, with experience in back-end bioinformatics as an intern at the [Lubbe Lab](https://labs.feinberg.northwestern.edu/lubbe/) at Northwestern and front-end design creating MapAbility. Here, you'll find some of my past projects, including class work, personal projects, and lab work. You can contact me at dhruvtkpatel@gmail.com or on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhruvtpatel/) with any questions or ideas — I'd love to help out!

# ✨ A Few Completed Projects

- ♿  [**MapAbility**](https://github.com/dhruvtpatel/MapAbility), an open-source tool that rates sidewalks, roadways, and public buildings on their accessibility for users with mobility disabilities.
- 🎤 [**DebateDash**](https://github.com/dhruvtpatel/DebateDash), an app offering automated timing, speech efficiency drills, recording, resources, and tips for debaters.
- ✂️ [**CardCut Pro**](https://github.com/dhruvtpatel/CardCutPro), a customizable card-cutting app for debate that automatically formats cards, saving time and effort for serious debaters.
- 🌎 [**LABRS**](https://github.com/dhruvtpatel/LABRS), a multi-algorithm pipeline that predicts a patient's risk to Parkinson's using local ancestral calculations and hidden-Markov models sequenced from reference datasets (e.g., 1000 Genomes Project, POPRES, HapMap, etc.)
- 📷 [**Patel Productions**](https://github.com/dhruvtpatel/PatelProductions), a website to showcase some of my videography work, including commercials, hype reels, PSAs, documenteries, and more.
- 👶 [**NameChrono**](https://github.com/dhruvtpatel/NameChrono), a tool that tracks the chronological history of a name and its potential future growth based on current trends and data analysis.
- 👭[**AbilityConnect**](https://qob.jlx.mybluehost.me/), a web (and soon-to-be app) platform that fosters connections among individuals experiencing rare mobility conditions (e.g., tremors, ataxia, dystonia, and more).

#### A Few More Simple, Fun Projects

- 🧮 [**Simple Calculator**](https://github.com/dhruvtpatel/SimpleCalculator), my very-first project that recreates a scientific calculator, but with no special plug-ins or libraries.
- 🔢 [**24 Game**](https://github.com/dhruvtpatel/24Calculator), an app tasking users to "make" 24 with four numbers and basic mathematical operations.
- 🚩[**Flag Drawer**](https://github.com/dhruvtpatel/FlagDrawer), a program that draws the flag of any country in the world for a specific width/height.
- **and a lot more in repos!**

### Projects I'm Working On

- 🎤 **CardSearch**, an automated debate evidence finder for debaters looking to expedite their searches.

## 🌱 Language Expertise

I'm experienced in **C#, Bash, Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript.** I'm learning Swift, React, and Flutter right now!
