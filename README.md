# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dhruv Patel, and I'm a senior at the Ilinois Math and Science Academy (IMSA). I'm interested in full-stack app and web development, with experience in back-end bioinformatics as an intern at the [Lubbe Lab](https://labs.feinberg.northwestern.edu/lubbe/) at Northwestern and front-end design creating MapAbility. Here, you'll find some of my past projects, including class work, personal projects, and lab work. You can contact me at dhruvtkpatel@gmail.com or on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhruvtpatel/) with any questions or ideas â€” I'd love to help out!

# âœ¨ Projects I've Been Working On

- â™¿ [**MapAbility**](https://github.com/dhruvtpatel/MapAbility), an open-source tool that rates sidewalks, roadways, and public buildings on their accessibility for users with mobility disabilities.
- - ðŸ“· [**Patel Productions**](https://github.com/dhruvtpatel/PatelProductions), a website to showcase some of my videography work, including commercials, hype reels, PSAs, documenteries, and more.
- ðŸ‘¶ **NameChrono**, a tool that tracks the chronological history of a name and its potential future growth based on current trends and data analysis.
- ðŸŒŽ **LABRS**, a multi-algorithm pipeline that predicts a patient's risk to Parkinson's using local ancestral calculations and hidden-Markov models sequenced from reference datasets (e.g., 1000 Genomes Project, POPRES, HapMap, etc.)
- ðŸ‘­[**AbilityConnect**](https://qob.jlx.mybluehost.me/), a web (and soon-to-be app) platform that fosters connections among individuals experiencing rare mobility conditions (e.g., tremors, ataxia, dystonia, and more).


#### A Few Basic, Fun Projects:

- ðŸ§® **Simple Calculator**, my very-first project that recreates a scientific calculator, but with no special plug-ins or libraries.
- ðŸš©**Flag Drawer,** a program that draws the flag of any country in the world for a specific width/height.

## ðŸŒ± Language Expertise

I'm experienced in **C#, Bash, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.** I'm learning Swift, React, and Flutter right now!
