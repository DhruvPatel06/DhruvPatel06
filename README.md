# Welcome! 👋

My name is Dhruv Patel, and I'm a senior at the Ilinois Math and Science Academy (IMSA). I'm interested in full-stack app and web development, with experience in back-end bioinformatics as an intern at the [Lubbe Lab](https://labs.feinberg.northwestern.edu/lubbe/) at Northwestern and front-end design creating AbilityConnect. Here, you'll find some of my past projects, including class work, personal projects, and lab work. You can contact me at dhruvtkpatel@gmail.com or on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhruvtpatel/) with any questions or ideas — I'd love to help out!

# ✨ Some Projects I've Been Working On

- 👭**AbilityConnect**, a web (and soon-to-be app) platform that fosters connections among individuals experiencing rare mobility conditions (e.g., tremors, ataxia, dystonia, and more).
- 👶 **NameChrono**, a tool that tracks the chronological history of a name and its potential future growth based on current trends and data analysis.
- 🌎 **LABRS**, a tool that predicts a patient's risk to Parkinson's using local ancestral calculations and hidden-Markov models sequenced from reference datasets (e.g., 1000 Genomes Project, POPRES, HapMap, etc.)
