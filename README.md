# Welcome! 👋

My name is Dhruv Patel, and I'm a senior at the Ilinois Math and Science Academy (IMSA). I'm interested in full-stack app and web development, with experience in back-end bioinformatics as an intern at the [Lubbe Lab](https://labs.feinberg.northwestern.edu/lubbe/) at Northwestern and front-end design creating AbilityConnect. Here, you'll find some of my past projects, including class work, personal projects, and lab work. You can contact me at dhruvtkpatel@gmail.com or on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhruvtpatel/) with any questions or ideas — I'd love to help out!
